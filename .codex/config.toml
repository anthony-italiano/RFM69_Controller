# Codex workspace config (created to override a Linux /usr/bin/bash default on Windows)
# If Codex attempted to call /usr/bin/bash, Windows will fail; this forces PowerShell instead.
# Backup or delete this file to revert.

# Path to shell program to run for tasks (use a Windows-native shell)
shell = "C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe"

# Arguments passed to the shell. For PowerShell, use -NoLogo and -NoProfile.
# Many extensions expect a POSIX shell, so some features may still require WSL.
shellArgs = ["-NoLogo", "-NoProfile", "-Command"]

# Optional: if the extension supports an explicit working directory key, set it.
#workspaceCwd = "${workspaceFolder}"

# NOTE: If you use WSL and prefer that, change `shell` to the full path of wsl.exe:
# shell = "C:\\Windows\\System32\\wsl.exe"
# shellArgs = ["-e", "bash", "-lc"]
